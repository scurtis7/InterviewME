- deserialize converts a byte stream into an object with state'),

Example: Shape interface
  - Factory method that takes number of sides.  If 3 passed in returns triangle, if 4 square, etc.
Example: File interface
  - Returns file based on extension'),

  - Checked at compile time
  - Must provide try-catch
  - Compile time error if not try-catch
  - Examples (IOException & ClassNotFoundException)
Unchecked Exception (Runtime)
  - Unchecked (checked at runtime)
  - No try-catch needed
  - No compile error
  - All unchecked exceptions are descended from Runtime Exception
  - Examples (NullPointerException & ArrayIndexOutOfBounds)'),

private static int i = 0;
and you increment it ( i++ ) in one instance, the change will be reflected in all instances.'),

        ('JAVA', 'EASY', 'What value is returned for all class constructors?', 'Class constructors donâ€™t have a return type. ðŸ˜ƒ
    - Bonus Question: Why donâ€™t constructors have a return type?
        - Because the constructor is not called directly by your code, it''s called by the memory allocation and object initialization code in the runtime.'),

When would you use an instance variable as opposed to a local variable? When would you use a class variable?', '- Local variables are defined inside methods, constructors or blocks. They will be declared and initialized within the method and destroyed when the method has completed.
- Instance variables are defined within a class but outside any method. These variables are instantiated when the class is loaded.
- Class variables are declared within a class, outside any method with the static keyword.'),
        ('JAVA', 'EASY', 'What is a constructor?', '- Constructor is just like a method that is used to initialize the state of an object.
- It is invoked at the time of object creation.

- JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of the JVM.
- JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools'),

- A StringBuilder is mutable but is not thread safe. StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer
- A StringBuffer is mutable and is thread safe. StringBuffer is synchronized and therefore thread safe but slower than StringBuilder.'),

        ('JAVA', 'MEDIUM', 'What is an enum?', '- An enum is a special type that a programmer can define for a collection of constants. It is a special type of Java class.
- You should use an enum when there is a finite number of possible values for a field or parameter.
- You can also use an enum for code re-use so you don''t have to define the value over and over when it''s used.'),
        ('JAVA', 'MEDIUM', 'What are java streams? Describe what you know about them.', '- Streams are wrappers around a data source
- Makes bulk processing convenient and fast
- They use lambda expressions (functional programming)

You would then implement the compareTo method which returns positive number if the current object is greater then passed in object and negative number for the reverse of that.
