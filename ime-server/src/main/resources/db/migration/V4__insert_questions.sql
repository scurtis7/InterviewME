â€¢	It defines a specific set of methods and their arguments.

It is a subset of a subunit of a process.	It is a program in execution containing multiple threads.

        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'What are the wait() and sleep() methods?', 'wait(): As the name suggests, it is a non-static method that causes the current thread to wait and go to sleep until some other threads call the notify () or notifyAll() method for the objectâ€™s monitor (lock). It simply releases the lock and is mostly used for inter-thread communication. It is defined in the object class, and should only be called from a synchronized context.

sleep(): As the name suggests, it is a static method that pauses or stops the execution of the current thread for some specified period. It doesnâ€™t release the lock while waiting and is mostly used to introduce pause on execution. It is defined in thread class, and no need to call from a synchronized context.  '),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'Explain the meaning of the deadlock and when it can occur?', 'Deadlock, as the name suggests, is a situation where multiple threads are blocked forever. It generally occurs when multiple threads hold locks on different resources and are waiting for other resources to complete their task.

For example two threads are blocked forever.  Thread 1 is holding Object 1 but needs object 2 to complete processing whereas Thread 2 is holding Object 2 but needs object 1 first. In such conditions, both of them will hold lock forever and will never complete tasks.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'Explain volatile variables in Java?', 'A volatile variable is basically a keyword that is used to ensure and address the visibility of changes to variables in multithreaded programming. This keyword cannot be used with classes and methods, instead can be used with variables. It is simply used to achieve thread-safety. If you mark any variable as volatile, then all the threads can read its value directly from the main memory rather than CPU cache, so that each thread can get an updated value of the variable.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'How do threads communicate with each other?', 'Threads can communicate using three methods i.e., wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'Can two threads execute two methods (static and non-static concurrently)?', 'Yes, it is possible. If both the threads acquire locks on different objects, then they can execute concurrently without any problem.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'What will happen if we don''t override the thread class run() method?', 'Nothing will happen if we donâ€™t override the run() method. The compiler will not show any error. It will execute the run() method of thread class and we will just not get any output because the run() method is with an empty implementation.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'Is it possible for each thread to have its own stack in multithreaded programming?', 'Yes. In multithreaded programming, each thread maintains its own separate stack area in memory because each thread is independent of each other rather than dependent.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'Is it possible to call the run() method directly to start a new thread?', 'No, it''s not possible to start a thread. You need to call the start() method to create a new thread otherwise run method won''t create a new thread. Calling the run() method it will behave like a normal method and not start a new thread.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'Explain context switching.', 'Context switching is an important feature of multithreading. It is the process of switching the CPU from one thread or process to another one. It allows multiple processes to share the same CPU. In context switching, the state of a thread or process is stored so that the execution of the thread can be resumed later if required.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'How can we achieve thread safety in Java?', 'There are several ways to achieve thread, safety in Java â€“ synchronization, atomic, concurrent classes, implementing concurrent, lock, interface, using volatile keyword, using immutable classes and thread, safe classes.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'What is more preferred - Synchronized method or Synchronized block?', 'Synchronized block is the more preferred way because it doesnâ€™t lock the object, synchronized methods lock the object.  If there are multiple synchronization blocks in the class, even though they are not related, it will stop them from executing and put them in wait state to get the lock on object.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'What do you mean by the ThreadLocal variable in Java?', 'ThreadLocal variables are special kinds of variables created and provided by the Java ThreadLocal class. These variables are only allowed to be read and written by the same thread. Two threads cannot see each otherâ€™s ThreadLocal variable, so even if they execute the same code, then there won''t be any race condition and the code will be thread-safe.'),
        ('JAVA', 'HARD', 'What is a race condition?', 'A Race condition is a problem which occurs in the multithreaded programming when various threads execute simultaneously accessing a shared resource at the same time. The proper use of synchronization can avoid the Race condition.');
